Vim Zoomwin
===========

A simple vim plugin to focus or zoom in on a single split window and be able to
restore it again.

Install
=======

For vim-plug

```vim
Plug 'markstory/vim-zoomwin'
```

Usage

This plugin exposes a `:ZoomToggle` command and binds that command to `<Leader>z`.
Push that chord once to focus and once again to unfocus a split window.
